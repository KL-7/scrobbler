And more over here ladies & gents:

Debut single ‘Knocking’ out May 4th & the WAYP debut album landing July 20th

10 great facts everybody should know about Will and The People... 

1. If you are a fan of Will and The People you may not know it but that makes you an official WATP Soldier (of love not violence!!)

2. The band love making homemade video versions of their tracks. Can you make your own too? Go to http://www.youtube.com/willandthepeople for details

3. They also just shot their first photo-shoot - get in!!

4. They have just finished a tour with The Script and will be announcing tons more London and regional dates over the forthcoming weeks, so keep your eyes on this space…

5. Enter the competition to cameo in the video for Will’s 2nd single (in myspace/facebook/bebo)

6. They were tipped in The Sun and The Star for 09 bands to watch

7. Look in the blog section of the band Myspace to ask Will a question! The best 10 questions from fans will be answered each week

8. Will cooks a damn fine roast

9. Dan (the bassist) is Swedish. He wears a union jack towel on his head every morning after a steamy shower. If you see him ask him to say “rizla”

10. Their alter ego band “Pill and the Weeple” come out once in a blue moon so be prepared… they are heavier than Cradle of Filth

Oh, and they are off on tour with Girls Aloud in May.

A quick history… Will, Dan and Noddy met in brighton at college 4 years ago, they all had different bands and used to (and still do) play and party together…a lot… Tills (keys) met Will at a piano bar in the after-hours sometime in 2006, Will was mightily impressed seeing him on the ivory - he was also a doctor…. so it was a no brainer for Will! They had to Jam! It was sweet as pineapple when they did the next day, and Tilley was in the gang. Max Tempo (drums) saw Will by himself playing in a tiny gig in Brighton around the same time, with a loop pedal, a guitar, and only bar-staff for company.. he said said in an outburst of hypnotic energy.. “I’m playing drums for you” This happened fast.. and the line up was ready to go…. Will and the People were born in a tiny studio underneath a chicken shop in Brixton… they still rehearse there and got a record deal in may 2008. Their debut album is out this summer! LOVE!]]></description>

Machinefabriek
Machinefabriek (Rutger Zuyderveldt from Arnhem, Holland) is amongst the finest experimental/electronic artists of recent years – his ultra-prolific back catalogue showcases his ability to perfect classical ambience, organic drone soundscapes, electronic minimalism and cathartic noise, and he has been hailed as one of the most interesting new experimental musicians by the Wire magazine. 

"Lawine' showcases the singular talent of Rutger Zuydervelt, his ability to morph from near-absolute sonic stilness to noise jams with slow, barely descernible stealth" - The Wire 

"QUITE POSSIBLY ONE OF THE FINEST ALBUMS OF THE YEAR... Rutger Zuydervelt has married the smart post rock sensibility of Mogwai with something far more experimental and the crunchy turntablism of Jeck with something far more accessible. The resulting sound is a deeply immersive collection of experiments, populist sounds with a noisy bent, or post rock without the rock." - Boomkat

Xela  
John Twells is the man we can all hold responsible for twisting his former beautiful harmonious electronica sound, into the shady, underworld atmospheres of his recent <i>In Bocca Al Lupo</i>. The resulting zombiefication is Xela. In past live sets, Xela delivers with improv layers of voice, strings, percussion, everyday objects, all viscerally manipulated masterfully through a lengthy chain of analogue effects. The result is immense. Beyond the hazy fog of crackling noise we are haunted by the eerie presence of distant bells, chimes, chants, and groans. "Xela has always been able to pre-empt the shifting tides of electronic music and deliver a statement that's definitively of its time” (Boomkat). Including his recent recordings on cassette format (!), he features on labels City Centre Offices, Digitalis, Type, Neo Ouija, and the new SMTG. John has also collaborated under the moniker Yasume, and he has remixed many experimental and electronic artists including Anduin, The North Sea, Gareth Hardwick, Gulskra Artikler, and... Machinefabriek. John is also the owner of Type Records. 

Simon Scott  
His debut album <i>Navigare</i> soon to feature on Erik Skodvin’s (aka Deaf Center / Svarte Greiner) Miasmah label, Simon Scott is set to be a household name in conceptual music (released June ‘09). Simon is the former Slowdive drummer who puts out international experimental music on his UK label Kesh Recordings. In Slowdive, Simon worked with Brian Eno and drummed on <i>Souvlaki</i>, an album voted by The Guardian in 2007 as “one of the top 50 albums to hear before you die”. Simon has also played in bands including Epic 45, The Sight Below, Lowgold, St.Etienne, Inner Sleeve, Jamie Liddell and Chapterhouse. He is now associated as producer / remixer with a host of contemporary acts including  Taylor Deupree, Hannu, Jasper TX, Steinbruchel, Isan, Millimetrik, Akira Kosemura, Populous, ON, Klimek, Emanuele Errante and Rafael Anton Irisarri. Through Simon’s dimly-lit soundscapes, we encounter shimmering melodies that gather and disperse through apocalyptic rhythms, surrounded by layers of harmony that hover over found-sounds. Simon also collaborates under the moniker Seavault (Morr Music) with A.Ryan from Isan, and also goes under the name Televise.]]></description>

  <title>WOTGODFORGOT Presents - GRAILS on 11 May 2009</title>
  <description><![CDATA[Location: Ruby Lounge

GRAILS

Originally conceived as a casual side-project in 2000, Portland, Oregon's Grails have patiently developed into a rather radical study in tension and meditation, inhabiting a netherworld where virtually all earthly and otherwordly sounds are equally explored to reflect the disparate influences of its four members. After releasing their first two albums on the Neurosis imprint Neurot Recordings, Grails followed up with 'Black Tar Prophecies Vol's 1,2 &, 3' on Important Records before ultimately finding their home at Temporary Residence Ltd.

Anti-Pop Consortium LIVE / DJ Woody / Peter Parker / Rich Reason / Just Good Beats / ELAVI. The alternative opening event of the 2009 festival features an extremely rare UK live performance from the legendary NYC based hip-hop crew Anti-Pop Consortium plus support from local heroes Dj Woody and Fingathing's Peter Parker, playing solo on MPC's as Parkertron. Anti Pop Consortium are the unsung heroes of the leftfield hip-hop scene admired by luminaries such as Radiohead, who invited the band to open for them on their Amnesiac European tour, to fellow beat makers Dj Shadow and Public Enemy who they have toured with recently. Their live show is beat heavy and uncompromising with APC utilising the use of 5 x Shure SM58's, Akai MPC's, Moog Source, Apple Powerbooks and a MicroKorg to full effect. APC are true masters of their game, operating tightly as a unit and doing what they do best, not to be missed.]]></description>

  <title>Futuresonic on 14 May 2009</title>
  <description><![CDATA[Location: City Wide

Futuresonic 2009 and the Social Technologies Summit will take place 13-16 May 2009, featuring world premieres of astonishing artworks, an explosive city-wide music programme, and visionary thinkers from around the world. The festival has four strands - Art, Music, Ideas and EVNTS - and occupies the orbits of art, performance, music, design and digital culture. Now in its 14th year, Futuresonic is the UK's leading festival for digital culture.

This year's music strand is the best, most explosive, most all-encompassing Futuresonic music lineup to date, covering genres as diverse as dubstep, contemporary classical, lo-fi indie, electronica, deep house, math rock, leftfield hip-hop and italo disco. 

A breathtaking AV show by Mexican electronica pioneer Murcof, a highly anticipated UK performance from Icelandic composer Johann Johannsson, and the legendary NYC based hip-hop crew Anti-Pop Consortium. Plus Kode 9, for many the UK's hottest DJ, headlining a showcase of UK bass music, and the fingerpicking prowess of guitarist Marnie Stern, hailed as 2009's most exciting rock act by New York Times.

The Futuresonic music strand will take over the finest venues in Manchester, including the RNCM, the Deaf Institute and Urbis, for a celebration of musicianship and a salute to those who perform on the cutting-edge.

In 2010 Futuresonic will return as FutureEverything.

Ewan has 20 years’ experience, including managing Feeder and Joss Stone and many other worthy credentials at Universal Music and Ministry Of Sound. The band will gain priceless knowledge on all aspects of the industry from recording to touring, benefiting from the abundance of top-notch music contacts that they’ll make along the way. To make sure the winners get the most out of their PUMA experience, they’ll be whisked away into a professional studio, complete with producer and engineer, to record two tracks that’ll be released digitally and supported with a strategic promotional campaign, including a PUMA photo shoot and six-date UK live tour. Needless to say, the band will also be kitted out with gear from PUMA’s legendary lifestyle ranges and re-releases from the heralded PUMA Archive collections….not a bad deal!

  <title>Sit Up Straight (part of the Futuresonic Festival) on 14 May 2009</title>
  <description><![CDATA[Location: The Bay Horse

£3 ON THE DOOR / FREE WITH DELEGATE PASS

Featuring live and DJ performances from Abigail Ward, SEC “__-___” and Boanthrope, Sit Up Straight is an avant-garde, experimental event held in the basement of The Bay Horse, covering both electro-acoustic and visual performance.

SEC

SEC is a live sound and visual performance incorporating two visual artists who manipulate archive film, original recordings, animation and graphics in real time with sound accompaniment via a laptop. Taking the irrational behavior of π we aim to relax its aggression by befriending its sibling numbers with shape form and colour produced with human interaction. An installation with a π number generator linked to the frequency of the audio produced by the sonic artist, and shape generator controlled by the visual artists.

__-___

This experimental partnership comes in the form of two artists currently working together under their "___-____." moniker. The two-piece will perform using guitar, saxophone and electronics looping the different elements to create sound scape. The end product is never decided and somewhat of a mystery, which creates high anticipation and quick thinking ultimately leading to an intense performance.

Boanthrope

Boanthrope (formely Meggidddo) was formed in late 2007, primarily as an attempt to introduce improvisation into the realm of avant-garde metal, hoping to create a lucid and ever shifting experience in which each players diverse music tastes and backgrounds are channeled and combined, where the only interlinking element is loudness and aggression. Recently, Boanthorpe have begun to shift from the orginal improvised sound into a more tightly constructed and composed form, combining saxophone, piano and synth onto our three guitar/bass/drum setup.

Swallowing the Seas

Swallowing the Seas is a shoegaze / slowcore project by B.H. Bhebhe.]]></description>

  <title>Toddla T &amp; MC Serocee / Hudson Mohawke LIVE / Daedelus LIVE / Tim Exile LIVE on 15 May 2009</title>
  <description><![CDATA[Location: Urbis

A stunning show of future music featuring devastating live performances from some of the most experimental and forward thinking electronic musicians from around the world. Toddla T heads the lineup up with an appearance on the night with his MC, Serocee. Toddla has been on form right throughout 2008, with the hardworking Sheffield Dj becoming increasingly well known for his dancefloor heavy mix of quality electronics, house, dancehall, ragga and pop. Playing live that night we have a double-headed Warp special with the frenetic, sometimes strange, often bizzare improvised power electronics of Tim Exile, to the future-proof glitch-hop of Glasgow's Hudson Mohawke, a producer considered to be one of the brightest lights in the UK electronic scene. Also appearing is the pioneering Los Angeles based electronica / jungle artist Daedelus showing his skills using a Monome controller - sealing this event to be one celebrating the true pioneers of the international electronic music scene. Room two will host an all night session from the DiY Soundsystem, the legendary party crew back in Manchester for one night only and celebrating 20 years of staging parties and raves across the UK and beyond.]]></description>

  <title>SOAP&amp;SKIN + ULTRE @ Futuresonic  on 15 May 2009</title>

Destined to become one of the most talked about events of the musical calendar is a billing with performances from Austria's lauded singer /songwriter Soap&Skin supported by Leeds based electronica specialist Ultre. Taking place in the reverent surroundings of Cross St Chapel, Soap&Skin's darkly melancholic vocal compositions and subtly enhanced electronica will make use of the venue's grand piano to create atmospheric ballads which have already attracted the attention of over half a million fans on MySpace and session bookings for Radio 2, Radio 3 and Radio 4.  This event is produced in collaboration with Humble Soul.

  <title>Otis Gibbs on 15 May 2009</title>
  <description><![CDATA[Location: Ruby Lounge

Otis Gibbs is a man in search of an honest experience. Some people refer to him as a folk artist, but that is a simplistic way to describe a man who has planted over 7,000 trees, slept in hobo jungles, walked with nomadic shepherds in the Carpathian Mountains, been strip-searched by dirty cops in Detroit, and has an FBI file. Otis has played everywhere from labor rallies in Wisconsin, to anti-war protests in Texas, Austria and the Czech Republic, Feed & Seed Stores in the Midwestern U.S. and in countless, theaters, festivals, bars and living rooms. Much of his work concentrates on the world that is ignored by pop culture. Sometimes forgotten, obsolete or simply marginalized, it is a world that doesn’t fit into a twenty-second sound bite or a White House talking point. Otis has spent the last fifteen years traveling across America and abroad documenting this world, and has a story to share about each stop along the way.

Otis grew up in the rural town of Wanamaker, Indiana. He first stepped on stage at the age of four, when he sang Jimmie Rodgers’ “Waiting for a Train” at a neighborhood honky tonk. While his parents worked countless hours trying to make ends meet, Otis was often in his uncle’s care. Not accustomed to parenthood, the uncle was sometimes bored, so the two would frequent bars, where Otis sang for tip money (which meant more booze for his uncle). Otis was hooked, and would often ask if they could go back and sing some more songs. The answer, “Only if you promise to never tell your parents.”

Otis started working when he was in high school. He stacked concrete blocks, flipped burgers, drove an ice cream truck, pumped gas, and did countless other crummy jobs. After discovering writers like Edward Abbey, Henry Miller and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, he started questioning what he was doing with his life. He was tired of working jobs that didn’t stimulate, or interest him in the least. So, in his own words, he decided to just “drop out.” Over the next four years, Gibbs earned and lived off less than $3,000 a year and had never been happier. He got rid of his car and shared apartments with artists, musicians and radicals (often living with 5 to 10 people). He also took advantage of the free time and wrote hundreds of songs. Otis sacrificed many of the comforts most of us take for granted, so that he could live a creative life.

The next few years were spent touring and releasing four indie records. The most notable being “49th and Melancholy,” (a stripped-down acoustic record, that was recorded to two-track reel-to-reel in a friend’s laundry room). There was also “Once I Dreamed of Christmas,” a collection of songs he’d written “for people who don’t like Christmas.”

In 2004, his critically acclaimed, “One Day Our Whispers” was released. It was an unpopular time to speak truth to power, but the album’s optimism and anti-war undertones resonated deeply with people who felt uncomfortable with the direction America was heading. Though songs like “I Wanna Change It,” “Thirty-three” and “Ours is the Time” have been described as protest songs, Otis prefers to call them “love songs for young radicals.” “The Peoples Day” was later included in a Wall Street Journal list compiled by Billy Bragg of the “Top Five Songs with Something to Say.” This placed Gibbs in the company of Bob Dylan, The Clash, Sam Cooke, and Chuck Berry.

His latest album, “Grandpa Walked a Picketline,” is a glimpse inside of an America that you don’t see on the evening news, but it is the America most of us see at our doorsteps. The album showcases Otis’ ability to breathe life into the characters of his songs. One such example is “Caroline.” The song tells the story of a woman who married too young. She finds herself stuck in an abusive relationship and secretly fears that her children will suffer the same fate. The populist anthem, “Everyday People” shines a light on the struggles our grandparents endured in the workplace. As the line in the song suggests, their generation’s willingness to take a stand, “made things better for you and me.” “Preacher Steve” is certain to ruffle some feathers, but a closer listen will reveal that the only people who should be offended by the song are those cynical clergymen who prey on fear for profit. This album is a reminder that Otis, above all else, is a damn fine songwriter. “Grandpa Walked a Picketline” was produced and mixed by Chris Stamey, engineered by legendary Motown engineer, Bob Olhsson, and was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee with an impressive list of players including, Al Perkins, Don Dixon, Tim Easton and Will Rigby.

Otis currently resides in Nashville, Tennessee with his long time girlfriend, Amy Lashley, their dog and two cats. Recently, he’s been examining ways of using bird feeding as a form of civil disobedience.

” In troubadour Otis Gibbs, we may have found America’s contemporary Billly Bragg. Not since late A&M period Phil Ochs have we heard such a distinctly American blending of the personal and the political”  Edward Burch, HARP MAGAZINE

“Gibbs is a Midwesterner with a long beard, a trucker’s hat and and a bag of sharply observed country-rock songs, some far enough to the left side of the political fence to make him a spiritual descendent of Woody Guthrie and brother of Steve Earle.”  Larry Katz, THE BOSTON HERALD

“This Indiana seed planter brings a breezy melodicism to acoustic songs with a leftist bent, which aligns him with the Seeger tradition of calling workers to unite while singing sweet, easy tunes that invite people to sing along.”  Michael McCall, THE NASHVILLE SCENE

  <title>Birthday Party Club Night on 16 May 2009</title>
  <description><![CDATA[Location: Ruby Lounge

BIRTHDAY PARTY dedicates itself to hosting the best new bands, the best dancers & best faced punters of 2009 and is brought to you by Mister Nick Holroyd and Mister Jay Taylor of SJM Concerts and The Ruby Lounge respectively and lands on the 3rd Saturday of each month here at The Ruby Lounge.

There’s a famous quote John Squire made to Q magazine just a few years ago where he referred to Ian Brown as “at best a tuneless knob, at worst a paranoid mess”. What does this have to do with Sydney’s finest proponents of psychedelic dance mania, The Lost Valentinos? Well, if one band could ever re-textualise the paranoid mess that a drug-fucked Ian Brown amounts to, then The Lost Valentinos is that band.

Whether it’s running from a mysterious gunman (Man With The Gun) to having their world collapse when they discover that their favourite author is in fact a syphilis-infested corpse (Kafka!), a look over the shoulder is as daily an activity for the band as pulling on cowboy boots. New single Rain sees no respite.

“Footsteps on the ceiling…” groans frontman Nik in muffled vocals that try to pierce through the wrong side of a nightmare, while Andrew Santamaria’s Morricone guitar trills and haunting echo add to their lost exoticism.

And this in only just over a year… 2005 saw The Lost Valentinos immediately established themselves as one of the most exciting acts in Sydney’s indie quarters.

By the time their self-titled EP (produced by Kim Moyes of The Presets) hit store shelves later in the year, their up-and-coming reputation was solidified, with the EP’s initial pressing selling out in its first week of release and publications such as Rolling Stone, Nylon and Vice UK hitting up the band for their tearjerking tale of success. Their first single, the noirish and anthemic “Man With The Gun”, immediately achieved high rotation on Triple J and earned the band a featured spot on the station’s Next Crop segment.

With their newest EP, Damn & Damn Again, The Lost Valentinos’ reputation as a gang of rogues intent on forging their own original sound has been cemented. Produced by pop svengalis Nick Littlemore and Peter Mayes (Pnau) and mastered in NY by the legendary Greg Calbi (The Strokes, Sonic Youth, Blondie), Damn & Damn Again is the haunting follow-up to their successful self-titled debut. It displays a band perfectly at ease with combining a shuddering shitstorm of rattling hi-hats and punk intensity with ambient soundscapes and noise-drenched melodies. Touching on My Bloody Valentine’s buried treasures, Spacemen 3’s drug-drenched psychedelia and, our old friends, the Stone Roses’ chiming choruses, the EP perfectly blends The Tinos’ need for experimentation with their love of torching the dance floor.

The EP is The Lost Valentinos’ first release since signing to the exciting new indie label Mosquito’s Tweeter in Australia. Vehemently DIY, the band has also recently notched up recordings on the highly influential Kitsune Maison III and Rallye labels in Japan. Coupled with a sold-out headline tour with the UK’s Johnny Boy and hi-profile upcoming slots at Parklife and The Church national tour, as well as an overseas sojourn that will see the band playing in the UK this October and Japan in November, The Lost Valentinos are set to spread their gospel like bush fire. And wanna hear the frightening thing? Well, in the bone-thin words of Karen Carpenter, “They’ve only just begun.”

Debut LOST VALENTINOS LP “Cities of Gold” produced by Ewan Pearson and out June 09.

  <title>Manchester Metal Collective All-Dayer (vol. iii) on 17 May 2009</title>
  <description><![CDATA[Location: Jabez Clegg

Right, you cunts, you are begrudgingly invited to the next MMC All-Dayer (vol. iii) at Jabez Clegg on Sunday the 17th of May.
This time we're going for THREE stages, with OVER THIRTY bands across the event. As usual, it's an all-ages show, will start early, finish late, there'll be DJ's, visuals, decor, stalls, art exhibition, food, giveaways, competitons and fucking loads more.

Cost: As the venue now has a contract with Blacka Acoustics we are not able to bring a sound system, and this means an increase in overall hire expenses. We are going to have to increase the ticket price by a couple of quid (taking it to £8 for a ticket and programme) BUT we have also added another stage with another ten bands, AND loads more random entertainment (tba) so it's still bloody good value for money.

IN SHORT, THIS ALL-DAYER IS GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST AND BEST INDEPENDANT MANCHESTER METAL EVENT - EVER.
TICKETS ARE ON SALE ON THURSDAY THE 19TH OF MARCH. GET THE FUCK ON IT...]]></description>

100% Genki brings four of Japan’s best contemporary music acts over to tour the UK’s main music events, for the first time.

Over ten days in May, the Japanese acts will play the UK’s most subscribed music events and festivals, bringing a taste of the Japanese music culture and energy to the British musical ear. As much visual as aural, their unique style is not to be missed!

The tour is bought to you by the organisers of the annual Fuji Rock festival, Smash, and is supported by Strummerville, the Joe Strummer New Music foundation. Please check below for short band info, links and the Tour Dates.

***THIS EVENT IS FREE ENTRY. COMPLIMENTARY BEER PROVIDED BY ASAHI, AND COMPLIMENTARY SUSHI FROM YO! SUSHI FOR EARLY ARRIVALS***

80kidz: Following in the footsteps of genre-mashing electronic artists such as Surkin, M.I.A, The Bang Gang DJs and Vitalic, 80kidz are ready to show the world what Tokyo can do. They have performed alongside Justice, Boys Noize and Hot Chip and remixed Cazals, CSS, Black kids and many more. Believe the hype.

De De Mouse: De De Mouse is the abstract, ambient brainchild of bespectacled Tokyo-based studio boffin Daisuke Endo. His fanbase ranges from the Tokyo fashion community to the crème de la crème of Japan’s J-Pop pop royalty and music critiques.

Riddim Saunter: Riddim Saunter, influenced by the Ska Boom of the late 90s, are famed for their frantic live shows. The band’s up-close, in-your-face style of performance won them support for the Go-Team’s first ever Japan tour.

Tucker: Tucker is a hyperactive one-man acrobatic band / turntablist / organ playing whirlwind. His confounding, high-energy mix of rock and roll, punk, pop, and hip-hop leaves critics fumbling for words; someone not entirely hip-hop, not entirely rock, not entirely retro, and perhaps not ever entirely serious has left many at a loss.

  <title>Great Lake Swimmers + Sharon Van Etten + Last Harbour at Dulcimer, Manchester on 19 May 2009</title>
  <description><![CDATA[Location: Dulcimer

Pineapple Folk and Hey! Manchester present Great Lake Swimmers plus Sharon van Etten and Last Harbour

Tickets from www.WeGotTickets.com, www.Ticketline.co.uk, www.SeeTickets.com, Piccadilly Records on Oldham Street, Dulcimer’s bar, Ticketline Box Office in St John’s Centre, Liverpool, and on 0161 832 1111.

Great Lake Swimmers are a Canadian band built around the melodic folk rock songs of singer-songwriter Tony Dekker, from Wainfleet, Ontario. The current touring line-up includes Tony Dekker on lead vocals, acoustic guitar and harmonica, Erik Arneson on banjo, electric guitar and harmonium, Greg Millson on drums, Darcy Yates on upright bass and Julie Fader on keyboards and vocals.

The band’s style has been compared to Red House Painters, Nick Drake, Iron & Wine and Neil Young, as well as Will Oldham (Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy) and Sufjan Stevens. Dekker has said his influences include Gram Parsons and Hank Williams.

Here’s how the Guardian described them last year:

'The delicate folky melodies are so touching and the alt-country beats so soothing that you want to give over every bit of you to taking them in. They have a great knack of building songs up slowly - first with the guitar, then the banjo, then the double bass and finally drums - to create a complex screen of sound.'

Support for this show comes from Brooklynite Sharon van Etten and one of our favourite local bands, Last Harbour. They’ve not been having bad press coverage either:

‘Swooning dustbowl rumbles, blackly turbulent like 16 Horsepower or Lift To Experience, with a Wild West baroque feel akin to Okkervil River‘ - Plan B

‘Classic outback brooding recalling the deathly pallor o contemporary Australians The Drones but also the intimate lethargy of Tindersticks‘ - Metro

This show takes place at Dulcimer, Manchester’s celebrated ‘folk bar’ in central Chorlton. Regular buses (85 and 86) run to Chorlton from the city centre, plus the 23 and 23A from Didsbury and West Didsbury and the 168 from Fallowfield. We recommend using GMPTE’s JourneyPlanner to arrange your trip:

“The darlings of the jazz/leftfield jazz scene” Big Chill Website

‘Sound like nothing you’ve ever heard” Time Out

“A phenomenon in the making” The Independent

“A strikingly original sound.“The Times

Portico Quartet are four young musicians from South London who sound like nothing you’ve ever heard before. Living and playing together they describe their ethos as like an Indy band that plays post-jazz, and their unique sound has won them fans from Gilles Peterson to Radio 4 and Notion to BBC Music Magazine, and made them Time Out’s Jazz, Folk and World music album of the year.

Portico Quartet are Jack Wylie (soprano Saxophone), Milo Fitzpatrick (double bass), Nick Mulvey (Hang and percussion) and Duncan Bellamy (drums and Hang), and it’s the mix of ethereal saxophone, flying saucer like Hang (imagine an otherworldly steel drum), clattering drums and earthy double-bass that gives their music it’s inimitable, beautiful sound.

It was the chance purchase of the Hang by Duncan Bellamy, at a music festival, that inspired the young friends to start a band, and while their largely intuitive music references jazz and African music it’s the Hang inspired trance-like repetitive patterns of Duncan and Nick Mulvey that propel the band into stranger pastures: invoking Philip Glass and Steve Reich’s gamelan inspired minimalism.

Their dance friendly, melodic brand of hook-heavy post-jazz was honed busking across Europe and playing in unusual spaces; churches, galleries and chill-out zones. A weekly session at the South Bank and residency at the Brixton Ritzy earned them a cult following and inspired London’s hippest jazz club, the Vortex, to start a label to release their music. Sessions on XFM and Radio 1 followed and a storming set at the Glastonbury Festival had Q hailing their ‘danceable chamber jazz soundscapes’ that ‘should make them a Glastonbury fixture’.

Some words about us and ‘Knee Deep In The North Sea’:

Jazz World and Folk Album of the year TimeOut

“Massively assured debut…this album showcases a singular and talented outfit, pivoting on a beautifully lithe rhythm section and foregrounding Jack Wyllie’s fluent saxophone to meditative and mesmerising effect.” TimeOut

“intriguing, bringing together and reshaping a variety of strands from jazz, world music and contemporary classical sources” The List

‘As traditionally hook based as anthing from rock, to hip hop” The Guardian

“This unforgettable disc shimmers with brilliance.” BBC Music Magazine

“Haunting, beautifully austere sound” Metro

“Danceable chamber jazz soundscapes combine hectic soprano sax riffing over a dynamic rhythm section and should make them a Glasto fixture” ‘best of the rest’ Q Glastonbury Review 2008

“Strange but beautiful stuff” Notion

“Floating somewhere between jazz and modern classical music, this young group make a strikingly original sound.“The Times

“The group generates pieces with a recognisably human pulse – ECM with a little extra passion, if you will..chamber jazz with a Late Junction twist” Sunday Times

“Their hook-based, jaunty, yet subtly layered music is tailor-made to find friends everywhere.”The Guardian

‘Fresh, fun and different…an ear for a highly quotable melody” jazzwise

” Great stuff,... a cross between jazz and modern classical. It’s mellifluous, exuberant and jaunty, full of catchy tunes and strong hooks” Allaboutjazz

“A band who make experimental and adventurous music sound wonderfully accessible, Portico Quartet are like nothing you’ve heard before.” Straight No Chaser
